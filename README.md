# Ransomware_Simulation
This project demonstrates a simple encryption and decryption mechanism using Base64 encoding in Python. Files in a specified directory are encrypted with Base64 encoding and can be decrypted back to their original content. The project includes two main Python scripts: one for encrypting files and another for decrypting them.
